// Declare two variables, dividend and divisor, and assign them any two numbers you like (make sure divisor is not zero). Use the modulus operator (%) to find the remainder when dividend is divided by divisor and store it in a variable called remainder. Print the value of remainder to the console.

let dividend = 15;
let divisor = 3; //not equal to zero

let remainder = dividend % divisor
console.log(remainder);
