// Declare two variables, total and parts, and assign them any two numbers you like (make sure parts is not zero). Divide total by parts and store the result in a variable called result. Print the value of result to the console.

let total = 15;
let parts = 3; //not equal to zero

let result = total / parts
console.log(result);
